                                Uganda's climate is naturally variable and susceptible to flood and drought events which have had negative socio-economic impacts in the past. Human induced climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5 ºC in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3 ºC by the 2080s.
                                <BR></BR>
                                With a high share of rain-fed cultivation, Ugandan crop production is more exposed to climatic variability than its neighbors in the Eastern African region. All the Matooke (plantains), cassava, sorghum, and more than 90% of the maize produced in the country are not irrigated and hence vulnerable to climatic changes.

                                Climate change in Tanzania is affecting the natural environment and residents of Tanzania. Temperatures in Tanzania are rising with a higher likelihood of intense rainfall events (resulting in flooding) and of dry spells (resulting in droughts).

                                Water scarcity has become an increasing problem and many major water bodies have had extreme drops in water levels, including Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika Lake Jipe, and Lake Rukwa.[3][1] Tanzania's agricultural sector, which employs over half of the population, is particularly vulnerable as farmers are predominantly dependent on rainfed agriculture.[3] On the other hand, increasing intense rainfall events have resulted in flooding across the region, which has damaged infrastructure and livelihoods.[4] A high percentage of the population of Tanzania lives along the coast and are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.[3] Sea level rise and changes in the quality of water are expected to impact these sectors and be a continued challenge for the country.[3]

Tanzania produced a National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) in 2007 as mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The NAPA identifies the sectors of agriculture, water, health, and energy as Tanzania's most vulnerable sectors to climate change.[5] In 2012, Tanzania produced a National Climate Change Strategy in response to the growing concern of the negative impact of climate change and climate variability on the country’s social, economic and physical environment.[6] In 2015, Tanzania submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC).[7]

                            Central Africa is characterized by hot and wet climates on both sides of the Equator. The equatorial strip that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Western Rift Valley is influenced throughout the year by the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), resulting in intense, heavy precipitation.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            The IPCC expects Central Africa to see a decrease in the length of wet spells and a slight increase in heavy rainfall. West Africa has been identified as a climate-change hotspot, with climate change likely to lessen crop yields and production, with resultant impacts on food security.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Central Africa will see particularly large increases in the number of hot days at both 1.5° C and 2° C. Over Southern Africa, temperatures are expected to rise faster at 2° C, and areas of the southwestern region, especially in South Africa and parts of Namibia and Botswana, are expected to experience the greatest increases in temperature.
