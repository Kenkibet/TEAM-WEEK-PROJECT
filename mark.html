        <p>Climate change is already a measurable reality and along with other developing countries, South Africa is especially vulnerable to its impacts<br> South Africa is expected to become hotter and drier, leading to changes in agricultural production
            and biodiversity distribution.<br> Causes of global warming include burning of fuel,deforestation,mining etc.This has caused the rise in sea level of coastal areas thus<br> causing flooding.One major problem experienced across South Africa
            is dry seasons becoming longer and wet seasons starting late affecting majority of the people who are farmers.</p>

        <img src="images/aridity.jpeg"><img src="images/flooding.jpeg"><img src="images/wildfire.jpeg">
        <p>Due to global warming Zambia will under go a lot of tough times.There would be a risk of its citizens facing a terrible famine and drought because of reduced rainfall.This will affect the foodchain caused by the said effect.To avert this problem
            the government will have to set aside millions of dollars to avert the disaster.Amother problem is that there will be increased wildfires burning the little vegetatiion left.During the short wet season high rainfall will be experienced thus
            possibility of causing floods</p>

        <p>Ghana is well known globally due to the productin of quality cocoa beans.This is on the brink of unknown times due to the effects of global warming.Due to longer droughts and short wet seasons cocoa production will fall drastically.This can however

        <p>Africa's most populous country and among the biggest economies in Africa is not spared either.It is among the countries that will experience the worst aftermath effects of global warming.This is because it is among the highly industrialized country's
            thereby a lot of greenhouse gas emission.Nigeria also has a vibrant mining sector which also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.This has brought about some environmental problems such as drying of rivers,floding along the coast etc.The
            supply of food crops will also be affected adversely </p>

            but of late due to global warming it has experienced snow fall which is a new thing.During the dry season it has experienced prolonged drought than usual.As a result it occasionally experiences heatwaves which at times has resulted to death
